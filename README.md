# PomodoroTimer

## About

Pomodoro Timers are used to study in incremental time periods with short breaks in between longer
study sessions. 

This pomodoro timer is easy to execute and runs in the terminal. It allows the user to select study
session length, break length, and amount of study sessions to be had. 

Enjoy, and study hard!
